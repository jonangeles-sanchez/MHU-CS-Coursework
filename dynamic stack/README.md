## Dynamic Stack - Basic Methods
See more details on this assignment by visiting [MHU's Moodle Site](https://moodle.mhu.edu/)

## Requirements
To complete this project successfully, you must perform the following tasks:
- [ ] Write `stack.cpp`. You will need to implement:
  - `top()`
  - `empty()`
- [ ] Write `teststack.cpp`. You should load your `Stack` with values and check each of its methods to make sure it behaves as expected.
To run your `teststack`:
    - `make`
    - `./mytest`
- [ ] Pass the unit tests. To run the unit tests:
  - `make test` - this will compile the unit tests
  - `./test` - this will test the Stack

## How to Submit
To submit your code to GitHub, you will need to perform the following tasks:
1. `make clean` - this will delete all of the compiled files in your directory
1. `git commit -a -m 'My code for grading'` - this will commit all files in your directory. Feel free to change the commit message
1. `git push` - this will push your code to GitHub
