## Extended Queue - Contiguous Implementation
See more details on this assignment by visiting [MHU's Moodle Site](https://moodle.mhu.edu/)

## Requirements
To complete this project successfully, you must perform the following tasks:
- [ ] Write `equeue.cpp`. You will need to implement:
  - `size()`
  - `full()`
  - `clear()`
  - `retrieveAndServe(Queue_entry &container)`
- [ ] Write `testeq.cpp`. You should load your `Extended_queue` with values and check each of its methods to make sure it behaves as expected.
- [ ] Pass the unit tests. To run the unit tests:
  - `make test` - this will compile the unit tests
  - `./qtest` - this will test the Queue
  - `./eqtest` - this will test the Extended_queue

## How to Submit
To submit your code to GitHub, you will need to perform the following tasks:
1. `make clean` - this will delete all of the compiled files in your directory
1. `git commit -a -m 'My code for grading'` - this will commit all files in your directory. Feel free to change the commit message
1. `git push` - this will push your code to GitHub
